## Hi there 👋

In a nutshell: 
- 🦷🪥I have a background in Dentistry and Scientific Methodology 👩‍🔬📑. 
- 📊 My uncontrollable enthusiasm for numbers during my PhD led me to start learning Statistics at UNICAMP :D
- 🎨 In my spare time, I draw and paint with watercolor pencils, which I find therapeutic.
